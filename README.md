# AutomaticSmartRevise
A bot which automatically solves/does your smart revise for you, and usually tries to get it right.

This works by the bot **scanning your screen** for the questions and answers, and sending it to an **AI Chatbot** to solve for you. No API key needed.

An example of it working (sometimes) (yes I did move the mouse on question 2 due to the bot failing) (please help improve)
